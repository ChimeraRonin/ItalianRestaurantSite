Code Louisville Project

My project is to try to replicate a simple restaurant site. It consists of the following:

* Home page <br>
* Menu page <br>
* locations page <br>
* JavaScript for the carousel in carscript.js <br>
* JavaScript for the Reservations modal function for in script.js <br>
* CSS - both a regular and normalize files <br>
* Images file containing any images used <br>

Outside having all the files, nothing special should be required to open it. It is responsive with smaller devices through Bootstrap and some CSS formatting.

It is painfully simple, and I still needed and received a good bit of help, for which I am very grateful. Before Code Louisville, I knew nothing about coding. Looking at my site, that may still appear to be the case.

I have learned a lot, and I intend to continue learning now that some of the sorcery behind coding has been slightly demystified.
